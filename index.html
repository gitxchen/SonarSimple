<p>The code in the is repo contains the software that implements the sonar sensor for smart phones.</p>

<p>We have updated the repository so that it contains the apk file. 
If you would like to quickly test the application you don't have to download the entire repository and compile it. You can simply click on the link below. </p>

<p><strong>Currently the application is configured to take samples until it get 10 good readings. Once it gets these readings, it will output the average distance of these reading and the standard deviation of the readings. The phone must be held steady until it stops beeping. The application works best in outdoor environments at less than 4.5 meters</strong>

<p>Currently we only tested the system the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
<li>nexus 4 (works)</li>
<li>samsung s4 (does not work)</li>
<li>moto g ( does not work)</li>
<li>samsung s3 (does not work)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since there is so much diversity among the sound interfaces of android devices we would like to know if you were able to get it working on your device so that we can add it to list of compatible devices.</p>
