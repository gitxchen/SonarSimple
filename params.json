{"name":"Sonarsimple","tagline":"Sonar Sensor For Smart Phones","body":"### Welcome to Sonar Simple.\r\nThe code in the is repo contains the software that implements the sonar sensor for smart phones.\r\n\r\nClick below to watch a video demo of the systems\r\n[Video demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G0brXWCjwU \"Smartphone sonar ranging\")\r\n\r\n[![Little red ridning hood](http://i.imgur.com/7YTMFQp.png)](https://vimeo.com/3514904 \"Little red riding hood - Click to Watch!\")\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have updated the repository so that it contains the apk file. \r\nIf you would like to quickly test the application you don't have to download the entire repository and compile it. You can simply click on the link below. \r\n\r\n**Currently the application is configured to take samples until it get 10 good readings. Once it gets these readings, it will output the average distance of these reading and the standard deviation of the readings. The phone must be held steady until it stops beeping. The application works best in outdoor environments at less than 4.5 meters**\r\n[Download APK](https://github.com/researcher111/SonarSimple/blob/master/out/production/SonarSimple/SonarSimple.apk?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently we only tested the system the following platforms:\r\n* nexus 4 (works)\r\n* samsung s4 (does not work)\r\n* moto g ( does not work)\r\n* samsung s3 (does not work)\r\n\r\nSince there is so much diversity among the sound interfaces of android devices we would like to know if you were able to get it working on your device so that we can add it to list of compatible devices.\r\n  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
